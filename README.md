# GetLockedOutADAccounts
Have you ever encountered an AD (Active Directory) account that continually gets locked-out and you don't know which system is causing the lockout? Do you want to equip your Helpdesk staff to get this information quickly so that as the first line of support, they can act promptly on locked-out AD account calls.

"Get Locked Out AD Accounts" tool can help, without the need of additional permissions and the tool is unaffected if new DCs are introduced or removed from the AD environment.
